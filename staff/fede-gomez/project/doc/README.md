# Boardgames Hub
In order to enjoy the Boardgaem Hubs experience the user has to freely register.

Every user has their own homepage where they can access our vast boardgame database powered by data obtained from BoardGameGeek.com. Once there, they can add or remove games based on their real collection to later easily consult if needed. 

Finally, every user can register their session plays and link them to other friends (existing users). This way, everyone can easily share their game sessions, check scores, notes and even upload and see pictures from the play.
